**Abstract:** At leading power accuracy the QCD light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) for a heavy meson can be matched onto the LCDAs in the framework of heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) through a factorization formula. We examine the power corrections to this factorization in the renormalon model, which can associate the power corrections originating from high-twist contributions to the divergent series in a matching kernel. Our analysis indicates that the dominant power corrections originate from the virtual part of the vertex bubble chain diagrams, which generate poles at w=n+12,∀n∈ℕ and w=1 in the Borel plane. Employing phenomenological models for both HQET and QCD LCDA, we present a numerical estimate. The results indicate that the power corrections in the peak region are approximately 22% for the D meson and 7% for the B–meson. These findings showcase the magnitude and the potential importance of power corrections in achieving high-precision phenomenological predictions for heavy mesons.
