I have tried assembling and painting a new model—Wheeljack in Bumblebee (2019), a.k.a. Transformers 6 (2019). This time the sketch lines, battle-damage and matte paint effects look well improved.🤗🤗🤗

BTW, I believed that I have figured out much more new phenomenology in my research. It seems that I can try to prepare my paper (maybe for MNRAS) before the new year!
