***I am much grateful to my senior alumnus [Fangyuan Yu@Princeton](https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/fangyuan-yu) (俞方远), who guided me into the astrophysics society. Without your encouragement, I would not be able to resume pursuing my future.***

## Post Update (Up-to-date)

Real-time updates will be posted on the “Blog Updates” page.

(Posts at earlier times are still written in simplified Chinese, which I don’t have enough time to translate into English.🤧)

## About Me

My name is **Tu Guo** **(郭图)**, also known as **@归途如稽** (for example, on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/gui-tu-ru-ji)). I am an undergraduate student (admission in 2022, Strengthening Foundation Program/强基计划) at the School of Physics and Astronomy, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)**, and a direct-PhD student (admission in 2026) at the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, **Tsung-Dao Lee Institute (TDLI)**.

My previous research interests included **hep-th**, **hep-ph**, and **hep-lat**, under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Wang](https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/jsml/wangwei.html) **(王伟)** and Prof. [Hong-Jian He](https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/jsml/hehongjian.html) **(何红建)**. My current research focuses on **astro-ph**, under the supervision of Prof. [Dong Lai](https://donglai6.github.io) **(赖东)**, with topics including **compact objects** and **exoplanets**.

## About this Site

I will continuously update this website with my **research progress** and **learning activities**, and occasionally share personal reflections. Selected notes and thoughts previously published on platforms such as Zhihu would also be archived here. 

**Contacts via email at guitrj_sjtu@qq.com are warm welcomed.** 

### 📖Reflections on Foundational Study

The notes on this site will empasize more on the **“traces of thinking”** rather than a mere **“list of knowledge”.**

I focus on my reflections and takeaways over different stages of my learning (e.g., high-school physics Olympiad, undergraduate-level theorectical physics, quantum field theory, general relativity, and related mathematics). My personal experience is limited, but I hope these notes can offer useful reference points for fellow learners.

In the future, the content here will also expand to include formal study in astronomy and astrophysics, as well as selected updates on frontier techniques.

### 🧑‍💻Personal Research Updates

My research style tends to **combine insights from formal/analtical theory with the intuition afforded by numerical calculations**.

I may use lightweight numerical simulations as an auxiliary tool (a working criterion: an optimized implementation close to C running on a PC within roughly ~ 10<sup>0</sup>-10<sup>1</sup> hours). These computations help visualize complex physical processes and thereby support theoretical analysis.

While I do not avoid (sometimes maybe a little bit too) abstract mathematical tools, I prefer the process of simplifying complex problems than relying on purely elaborate/abstract formalism, such as extensive (tensor) index manipulations and formal proofs.

My goal is to produce research outputs with **distinct insight** and **non-substitutable value**, and to refine wide-spread academic work that is **easy to be reproduced** and **built upon**.

### 🎮 Hobbies

I also welcome discussions about entertainment interests：

- **Games:** Console games; action (ACT); retro games; Souls-like; rhythm; ARPG; horror/survival horror; third-person shooters (TPS); etc.
- **Film/TV:** Sci-fi; thriller; mind-bending narratives; history; action. I am also interested in screenwriting, directing, and film analysis.
- **Music:** Electronic, EDM, Western pop/country, Electro-pop, OST, Classical, Ambient, J-Pop; etc. 
- **Model Kits:** Transformers (G1, *Prime*, live-action film, IDW), Gundams, domestic model lines, etc; I am still practicing building personal-made plastic models.

## AI Usage

Recently, my rapid knowledge acquisition and dev-work have benefited substantially from **ChatGPT**, **CodeX**, and **Gemini**. In particular, I really appreciate Gemini & CodeX’s capablity on front-end development, which made me willing to confront a complex codebase and attempt to launch and maintain a personal website.
